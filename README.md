# Explaining AI for Construction

Welcome to the Explaining AI for Construction repository, where we focus on demonstrating machine learning techniques that enhance transparency and fairness in construction-related predictions. This repository hosts Jupyter notebooks showcasing different approaches for explainable and fair machine learning, specifically tailored to applications like concrete strength prediction.

## Repository Contents

- `ExplanableAi.ipynb` - A detailed notebook that walks through several machine learning models. It focuses on predicting concrete strength using various inputs and discusses the models' fairness and explainability. Techniques like SHAP, Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), and fairness analysis using Fairlearn are covered.

## Project Objectives

- **Model Transparency**: Illustrate how decisions made by machine learning models can be explained using interpretability tools.
- **Fairness in AI**: Assess and promote model fairness across different groups to ensure equitable outcomes.
- **Educational Insight**: Provide comprehensive content for stakeholders interested in integrating fairness and explainability into their machine learning workflows.
